# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
We were tasked with creating a map showing all earthquakes in the last 7 days, the tectonic plates and all major earthquakes on earthquakes
## Results
We created three base maps: streets, satellite and navigation dark. The user can toggle between the three base layers to view the earthquakes on different map backgrounds. The user can also choose to view the earthquake data, the tectonic plate data and/or the major earthquake data. There is a legend in the bottom right corner that shows how color of the circle cooresponds with the magnitude of the earthquake. Each earthquake circle marker is colored by the magnitude and the size of the circle cooresponds with the magnitude as well. The larger the circle, the higher the magnitude.
